I write to you — what more is there to say?
What else is there that I could tell you now?
I know it's in your power, come what may,
With scorn to make me suffer for my vow.
But you, should you but cherish for my plight
A single drop of pity, won't forsake me.
At first I thought that I would hold my tongue;
Believe me, you would never have discovered
My shame if I'd had any hopeful prospect
That even once a week I might have seen you
In our own village, only just to hear you
Speak, and to say a word to you, and then
To think and think of that one thing again
By day, by night, till our next meeting came.
